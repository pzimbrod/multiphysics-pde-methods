  abstract = {Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function space. In               hp               adaptive finite element methods, one defines these discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh.                          Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements, or for discontinuous Galerkin methods.                            In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms used in the implementation of               hp               methods for arbitrary elements, and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence, we list the information a description of a finite element has to provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an               hp               context. We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions, and demonstrate that the               hp               -specific parts of the program do not dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.II finite element library.},

The library uses advanced object-oriented and data encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements. Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries. The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.},

Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or ``colors,'' are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

The computational domain is the union of two overlapping regions: a larger domain to account for thermal effects, and a smaller region to account for the fluid flow. Temperature-dependent surface effects are accounted for via surface tension and Marangoni forces. The volume-of-fluid approach is used to track the free surfaces between the metal (liquid or solidified) and the ambient air. The numerical method incorporates all the physical phenomena within an operator splitting strategy. The discretization relies on a two-grid approach that uses an unstructured finite element mesh for diffusion phenomena and a structured Cartesian grid for advection phenomena. The model is validated through numerical experiments, the main application being laser melting and polishing.},

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), a powder bed fusion AM process, has been dramatically accepted in various industries due to its versatility with several materials, including alloys. This comprehensive review article primarily explains the basic principle of the LPBF process, scientific and technological progress of several inter-related parameters, feedstock materials, produced properties/defects, and insights of numerical modelling to virtually understand the process behavior. Specific attention has been given to selective laser-meted (LPBFed) properties, driven through the microstructure formations and, thereby, concerning defects. The scope of the post-processing techniques to refine microstructure has also been discussed in this review paper. It has been identified that the defects are vital in LPBF process and are primarily governed by the process parameters. Therefore, a wisely chosen, optimized set of parameters can play a crucial role in minimizing defects considerably. Finally, the numerical modeling discussed in this review paper will help the researchers understand the LPBF process.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a novel discontinuous Galerkin method for convectiondiffusion-reaction problems, characterized by three main properties. The first is that the method is hybridizable; this renders it efficiently implementable and competitive with the main existing methods for these problems. The second is that, when the method uses polynomial approximations of the same degree for both the total flux and the scalar variable, optimal convergence properties are obtained for both variables; this is in sharp contrast with all other discontinuous methods for this problem. The third is that the method exhibits superconvergence properties of the approximation to the scalar variable; this allows us to postprocess the approximation in an element-by-element fashion to obtain another approximation to the scalar variable which converges faster than the original one. In this paper, we focus on the efficient implementation of the method and on the validation of its computational performance. With this aim, extensive numerical tests are devoted to explore the convergence properties of the novel scheme, to compare it with other methods in the diffusiondominated regime, and to display its stability and accuracy in the convection-dominated case.},

Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods.

We show that, in spite of this fact, it produces approximations of the same accuracy. We also show that this method is more efficient than the discontinuous Galerkin method using globally divergence-free piecewise polynomial bases.

The methods fitting in the framework are a general class of mixed-dual finite element methods including hybridized mixed, continuous Galerkin, nonconforming, and a new, wide class of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. The distinctive feature of the methods in this framework is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the solution defined only on the boundaries of the elements. Since the associated matrix is sparse, symmetric, and positive definite, these methods can be efficiently implemented. Moreover, the framework allows, in a single implementation, the use of different methods in different elements or subdomains of the computational domain, which are then automatically coupled. Finally, the framework brings about a new point of view, thanks to which it is possible to see how to devise novel methods displaying very localized and simple mortaring techniques, as well as methods permitting an even further reduction of the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom.},

To take full advantage of modern GPU computing, a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) finite element algorithm with voxel mesh is proposed to solve the transient heat transfer problem involved in the L-PBF process. The accuracy of the developed simulator is demonstrated by comparing with a commercial software (ANSYS) using representative L-PBF process parameters and temperature-dependent thermal properties for Ti6Al4V. For efficiency, it is found that the process simulation has a significant speedup going from a single CPU to a single GPU implementation. A speedup is also observed with the matrix-free method compared to a linear solver using a sparse matrix, both on a single GPU. In addition, several schemes devised to gain higher efficiency are discussed in details, which include exclusion of inactive elements from the memory, adaptive meshing in the build direction, preconditioner, and layer lumping. Using these schemes, the adaptability and scalability of the developed simulator are demonstrated on a complex geometry. A calibration of the model is also performed in realistic conditions with a thermocouple measurement coming from experimental data.},

  abstract = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M⩾N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N=0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N=M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by choosing N{$\neq$}0 and M{$>$}N. The reconstruction operator is implemented for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each element using a new local continuous space{\textendash}time Galerkin method. As a result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, space{\textendash}time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for DG schemes in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results indicate that the new class of intermediate schemes (N{$\neq$}0,M{$>$}N) is computationally more efficient than classical finite volume or DG schemes. Finally, a large set of interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal and relativistic MHD as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a standard high order WENO finite volume discretization in space to cope with discontinuous solutions.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on finite volume methods. The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a ``balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called ``control volume;'' by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

  abstract = {We develop a continuum phase-field model for the simulation of diffusion limited solid-solid phase transformations during lithium insertion in LiFePO4-nano-particles. The solid-solid phase boundary between the LiFePO4 (LFP)-phase and the FePO4 (FP)-phase is modeled as a diffuse interface of finite width. The model-description explicitly resolves a single LiFePO4-particle, which is embedded in an elastically soft electrolyte-phase. Furthermore, we explicitly include anisotropic (orthorhombic) and inhomogeneous elastic effects, resulting from the coherency strain, as well as anisotropic (1D) Li-diffusion inside the nano-particle. In contrast to other related research work, we employ an Allen-Cahn-type phase-field approach for the diffuse interface modeling of the solid-solid phase boundary. The model contains an extra non-conserved order parameter field to distinguish the two different phases. The evolution of this order parameter field is controlled by an extra kinetic parameter independent from the Li-diffusion. Further, the effect of the nano-particle's size on the kinetics of FP to LFP phase transformations is investigated by means of both model. Both models predict a substantial increase in the steady state transformation velocity as the particle-size decreases down to dimensions that are comparable with the width of the interface between the FP and the LFP-phase. However, the extra kinetic parameter of the Allen-Cahn-type description may be used to reduce the strength of the velocity-increase with the decreasing particle size. Further, we consider the influence of anisotropic and inhomogeneous elasticity on the lithiation-kinetics within a rectangularly shaped LiFePO4-particle embedded in an elastically soft electrolyte. Finally, the simulation of equilibrium shapes of LiFePO4-particles is discussed. Within a respective feasibility study, we demonstrate that also the simulation of strongly anisotropic particles with aspect ratios up to 1/5 is possible.},

  abstract = {Diffuse interface descriptions offer many advantages for the modeling of microstructure evolution. However, the numerical representation of moving diffuse interfaces on discrete numerical grids involves spurious grid friction, which limits the overall performance of the model in many respects. Interestingly, this intricate and detrimental effect can be overcome in finite difference (FD) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT)-based implementations by employing the so-called sharp phase-field method (SPFM). The key idea is to restore the discretization-induced broken translational invariance (TI) in the discrete phase-field equation by using analytic properties of the equilibrium interface profile. We prove that this method can indeed eliminate spurious grid friction in the three-dimensional space. Focusing on homogeneous driving forces, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of spurious grid friction on the overall operational performance of different phase-field models. We show that the SPFM provides superior degrees of interface isotropy with respect to energy and kinetics. The latter property enables the frictionless motion of arbitrarily oriented diffuse interfaces on a fixed 3D grid.},

  abstract = {A continuum model of crack propagation in brittle viscoelastic materials is presented and discussed. Thereby, the phenomenon of fracture is understood as an elastically induced nonequilibrium interfacial pattern formation process. In this spirit, a full description of a propagating crack provides the determination of the entire time dependent shape of the crack surface, which is assumed to be extended over a finite and self-consistently selected length scale. The mechanism of crack propagation, that is, the motion of the crack surface, is then determined through linear nonequilibrium transport equations. Here we consider two different mechanisms, a first-order phase transformation and surface diffusion. We give scaling arguments showing that steady-state solutions with a self-consistently selected propagation velocity and crack shape can exist provided that elastodynamic or viscoelastic effects are taken into account, whereas static elasticity alone is not sufficient. In this respect, inertial effects as well as viscous damping are identified to be sufficient crack tip selection mechanisms. Exploring the arising description of brittle fracture numerically, we study steady-state crack propagation in the viscoelastic and inertia limit as well as in an intermediate regime, where both effects are important. The arising free boundary problems are solved by phase field methods and a sharp interface approach using a multipole expansion technique. Different types of loading, mode I, mode III fracture, as well as mixtures of them, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The phase-field method provides a powerful framework for microstructure evolution modeling in complex systems, as often required within the framework of integrated computational materials engineering. However, spurious grid friction, pinning and grid anisotropy seriously limit the resolution efficiency and accuracy of these models. The energetic resolution limit is determined by the maximum dimensionless driving force at which reasonable model operation is still ensured. This limit turns out to be on the order of 1 for conventional phase-field models. In 1D, grid friction and pinning can be eliminated by a global restoration of Translational Invariance (TI) in the discretized phase-field equation. This is called the sharp phase-field method, which allows to choose substantially coarser numerical resolutions of the diffuse interface without the appearance of pinning. In 3D, global TI restricts the beneficial properties to a few specific interface orientations. We propose an accurate scheme to restore TI locally in the local interface normal direction. The new sharp phase-field model overcomes grid friction and pinning in three-dimensional simulations, and can accurately operate at dimensionless driving forces up to the order of \$\$10\^\{4\}\$\$. At one-grid-point interface resolutions, exceptional degrees of isotropy can be achieved, if further the largely inhomogeneous latent heat release at the advancing solid-liquid interface is mitigated. Imposing a newly proposed source term regularization, the new model captures the formation of isotropic seaweed structures without spurious dendritic selection by grid anisotropy, even at one-grid-point interface resolutions.},

  abstract = {A finite-volume formulation is presented that solves the three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation on an unstructured, staggered, z-level grid, with the goal of simulating nonhydrostatic processes in the coastal ocean with grid resolutions of tens of meters. In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave field in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diffusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diffusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams{\textendash}Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity field that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure field is solved efficiently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run efficiently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface (MPI). The ParMETIS libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to efficiently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code using up to 32 processors.},

Two different techniques are presented: a local nonconforming approach for dealing with sliding lines, and a global regeneration of Voronoi tessellations for treating general unpredicted movements. Corresponding elements at consecutive times are connected in space-time to construct closed space-time control volumes, whose bottom and top faces may be polygons with a different number of nodes, with different neighbors, and even degenerate space-time sliver elements. Our final ALE FV-DG scheme is obtained by integrating, over these arbitrary shaped space-time control volumes, the space-time conservation formulation of the governing hyperbolic PDE system: so, we directly evolve the solution in time avoiding any remapping stage, being conservative and satisfying the GCL by construction. Arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time is achieved through a fully discrete one-step predictor{\textendash}corrector ADER approach, also integrated with well balancing techniques to further improve the accuracy and to maintain exactly even at discrete level many physical invariants of the studied system. A large set of different numerical tests has been carried out in order to check the accuracy and the robustness of our methods for both smooth and discontinuous problems, in particular in the case of vortical flows.},

  abstract = {The divergence constraint of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is revisite the mixed finite element framework. While many stable and convergent mixed eleme have been developed throughout the past four decades, most classical methods relax t divergence constraint and only enforce the condition discretely. As a result, these m ods introduce a pressure-dependent consistency error which can potentially pollute t computed velocity. These methods are not robust in the sense that a contribution fro the right-hand side, which influences only the pressure in the continuous equations, pacts both velocity and pressure in the discrete equations. This article reviews the the and practical implications of relaxing the divergence constraint. Several approaches f improving the discrete mass balance or even for computing divergence-free solutions be discussed: grad-div stabilization, higher order mixed methods derived on the basis an exact de Rham complex, //(div)-conforming finite elements, and mixed methods w an appropriate reconstruction of the test functions. Numerical examples illustrate bot the potential effects of using nonrobust discretizations and the improvements obtained utilizing pressure-robust discretizations.},

  abstract = {Hybridization through the border of the elements (hybrid unknowns) combined with a Schur complement procedure (often called static condensation in the context of continuous Galerkin linear elasticity computations) has in various forms been advocated in the mathematical and engineering literature as a means of accomplishing domain decomposition, of obtaining increased accuracy and convergence results, and of algorithm optimization. Recent work on the hybridization of mixed methods, and in particular of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, holds the promise of capitalizing on the three aforementioned properties; in particular, of generating a numerical scheme that is discontinuous in both the primary and flux variables, is locally conservative, and is computationally competitive with traditional continuous Galerkin (CG) approaches. In this paper we present both implementation and optimization strategies for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method applied to two dimensional elliptic operators. We implement our HDG approach within a spectral/hp element framework so that comparisons can be done between HDG and the traditional CG approach.},

  abstract = {The direct numerical simulation of metal additive manufacturing processes such as laser powder bed fusion is challenging due to the vast differences in spatial and temporal scales. Classical approaches based on locally refined finite elements combined with time-stepping schemes can only address the spatial multi-scale nature and provide only limited scaling potential for massively parallel computations. We address these shortcomings in a space-time Galerkin framework where the finite element interpolation also includes the temporal dimension. In this setting, we construct four-dimensional meshes that are locally refined towards the laser spot and allow for varying temporal accuracy depending on the position in space. By splitting the mesh into conforming time-slabs, we recover a stepwise solution to solve the space-time problem locally in time at this slab; additionally, we can choose time-slab sizes significantly larger than classical time-stepping schemes. As a result, we believe this setting to be well suited for large-scale parallelization. In our work, we use a continuous Galerkin{\textendash}Petrov formulation of the nonlinear heat equation with an apparent heat capacity model to account for the phase change. We validate our approach by computing the AMB2018-02 benchmark, where we obtain an excellent agreement with the measured melt pool shape. Using the same setup, we demonstrate the performance potential of our approach by hatching a square area with a laser path length of about one meter.},

Modern implementations of high-order methods with state-of-the-art multigrid solvers for the Poisson equation are considered, including fast matrix-free implementations with sum factorization on quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. For the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method, a multigrid approach that combines a grid transfer from the trace space to the space of linear finite elements with algebraic multigrid on further levels is developed. Despite similar solver complexity of the matrix-based HDG solver and matrix-free geometric multigrid schemes with continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite elements, the latter offer up to order of magnitude faster time to solution, even after including the superconvergence effects. This difference is because of vastly better performance of matrix-free operator evaluation as compared to sparse matrix-vector products. A roofline performance model confirms the advantage of the matrix-free implementation.},

We examine the differences, similarities, and connection among these methods in scheme formulations, implementation strategies, accuracy, and computational cost. The comparison and numerical experiments demonstrate that WGFEMs are viable alternatives to MFEMs and hold some advantages over DGFEMs, due to their properties of local conservation, normal flux continuity, no need for penalty factor, and definiteness of discrete linear systems.},

While WENO schemes on structured meshes are quite mature, the development of finite volume WENO schemes on unstructured meshes is more difficult. A major difficulty is how to design a robust WENO reconstruction procedure to deal with distorted local mesh geometries or degenerate cases when the mesh quality varies for complex domain geometry. In this paper, we combine two different WENO reconstruction approaches to achieve a robust unstructured finite volume WENO reconstruction on complex mesh geometries. Numerical examples including both scalar and system cases are given to demonstrate stability and accuracy of the scheme.},

A powder packing model, including particle size distribution based on the discrete element method, was developed to describe the relative density variation of the powder bed with different layer thicknesses. A finite element method model with Gaussian laser beam was established to predict the dynamic thermal behavior and flow mechanism of the particles for a single-line scanning. The level-set method was used to trace the free surface of the molten metal with temperature-dependent surface tension. A function to describe the relative density of the powder bed with its thickness was obtained. An evaporation model considering the influence of mass, energy loss, and evaporation on the surface morphology of the molten pool was established. According to the temperature and velocity field in the molten pool, a vortex formed by the Marangoni effect might decrease the depth and increase the width of the molten pool. The molten pool was not disconnected by Plateau{\textendash}Rayleigh instability due to the small length/diameter ratio at low scanning speeds. The model assuming regularly arranged powder bed underestimates the maximum temperature as compared to the model considering a randomly packed powder bed because a higher relative density of the former facilitates heat conduction. The simulated results are consistent with experimental results, including porosity, material loss, and surface defects.},

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBFAM) of metals has the potential to enable new paradigms of product design, manufacturing and supply chains while accelerating the realization of new technologies in the medical, aerospace, and other industries. Currently, wider adoption of PBFAM is held back by difficulty in part qualification, high production costs and low production rates, as extensive process tuning, post-processing, and inspection are required before a final part can be produced and deployed. Physics-based modeling and predictive simulation of PBFAM offers the potential to advance fundamental understanding of physical mechanisms that initiate process instabilities and cause defects. In turn, these insights can help link process and feedstock parameters with resulting part and material properties, thereby predicting optimal processing conditions and inspiring the development of improved processing hardware, strategies and materials. This work presents recent developments of our research team in the modeling of metal PBFAM processes spanning length scales, namely mesoscale powder modeling, mesoscale melt pool modeling, macroscale thermo-solid-mechanical modeling and microstructure modeling. Ongoing work in experimental validation of these models is also summarized. In conclusion, we discuss the interplay of these individual submodels within an integrated overall modeling approach, along with future research directions.},

  abstract = {We present a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical solution of steady and time-dependent linear convection{\textendash}diffusion equations. We devise the method as follows. First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding flux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then define a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the flux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore significantly reduced. If the problem is time-dependent, we discretize the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. This results in efficient schemes capable of producing high-order accurate solutions in space and time. Indeed, when the time-marching method is (p+1)th order accurate and when polynomials of degree p⩾0 are used to represent the scalar variable, the flux and the approximate trace, we observe that the approximations for the scalar variable, the flux and the trace of the scalar variable converge with the optimal order of p+1 in the L2-norm. Finally, we introduce a simple element-by-element postprocessing scheme to obtain new approximations of the flux and the scalar variable. The new approximate flux, which has a continuous inter-element normal component, is shown to converge with order p+1 in the L2-norm. The new approximate scalar variable is shown to converge with order p+2 in the L2-norm. For the time-dependent case, the postprocessing does not need to be applied at each time-step but only at the times for which an enhanced solution is required. Moreover, the postprocessing procedure is less expensive than the solution procedure, since it is performed at the element level. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence properties of the method.},

Compared to the conventional FEM using the global stiffness approach and a uniform mesh running on 10 CPU cores, l-PBF process simulation based on the proposed methodology running on a GPU card with 5,120 Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores enables a speedup of over 10,000x. This significant speedup facilitates detailed thermal history and melt pool geometry predictions at high resolution for centimeter-scale parts within days of computation time. Two parts consisting of various geometric features are simulated to reveal the effects of scan strategy and local geometry on melt pool size variation, which correlate well with melt pool and lack-of-fusion porosity measurements obtained via experiment.},

The proposed work presents an efficient adaptive remeshing technique that enables part-scale SLM process simulations and helps reduce model size without sacrificing accuracy with the purpose of making the part-scale simulation computationally efficient. In particular, the SLM process simulation for an entire part was developed with the capability of considering different process parameters. The model predicts the influence of process parameters on part thermal history, melt pool statistics, and porosity. The simulation results agree well with the experimental results in literature. In addition, the remeshing technique was demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than the existing element death and birth approach.},

The domain in the vicinity of a given central point is broken into eight 45 degree pie shaped segments and the closest finite-difference point in each segment to the center point is noted. By utilizing Taylor series expansions about a central point with a unique averaging process for the points in the four diagonal segments, good approximations to all derivatives up to the second order and including the mixed derivatives are obtained. For square meshes the general derivative expressions for arbitrary meshes which were determined reduce to the usual finite difference formulae. In one example problem the Poisson equation is solved for an irregular mesh. In a second example for the first time a problem with a geometric nonlinearity, namely large deflection response of a flat membrane, is solved with an irregular mesh. The solutions compare very favorably with results obtained previously. Some discussion is given on possible approaches for determination of finite difference derivatives higher than the second.},

The underlying mesoscopic description of a propagating crack results in a complicated moving boundary problem, that allows the self-consistent determination of the crack velocity as well as the entire time-dependent crack surface. Here we focus on the numerical aspects tied to the approximative solution of the arising moving boundary problem and discuss several strategies to develop efficient numerical schemes applying to it: i) a finite difference scheme, ii) a scheme based on the finite element method and iii) a scheme based on the multipole expansion method. The pros and cons of each method are elucidated in detail. Further, we present a comprehensive view on how the different approaches can be employed to validate each other in comparative studies, which is then illustrated for the example of crack propagation under mode I loading.},

In contrast to many existing approaches to part-scale simulations, this work simulates resolved scan tracks. A growing, adaptively refined mesh accurately captures the fine laser beam movement. However, the fine spatial resolution required for resolved scan tracks in combination with the high scan velocities mandates the use of comparatively small time steps. Explicit time integration schemes are well-suited for this setting, while unconditionally stable implicit time integration schemes are well-suited for the interlayer cool down phase. These two schemes are implemented in an efficient fast operator evaluation framework which provides significant performance gains and optimization opportunities. The capabilities of the novel framework are demonstrated through examples on the centimeter scale and a scan-resolved simulation of the NIST AM Benchmark cantilever specimen.},

The Sibson and the Laplace (non-Sibsonian) interpolants which are based on natural neighbours have shown promise within a Galerkin framework for the solution of partial differential equations. In this paper, we focus on the Laplace interpolant with a two-fold objective: first, to unify the previous developments related to the Laplace interpolant and to indicate its ties to some well-known numerical methods; and secondly to propose a Voronoi cell finite difference scheme for the diffusion operator on arbitrary unstructured grids. A conservation law in integral form is discretized on Voronoi cells to derive a finite difference scheme for the diffusion operator on irregular grids. The proposed scheme can also be viewed as a point collocation technique. A detailed study on consistency is conducted, and the satisfaction of the discrete maximum principle (stability) is established. Owing to symmetry of the Laplace weight, a symmetric positive-definite stiffness matrix is realized which permits the use of efficient linear solvers. On a regular (rectangular or hexagonal) grid, the difference scheme reduces to the classical finite difference method. Numerical examples for the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the finite difference scheme.

  abstract = {This study enables the use of very high-order finite-difference schemes for the solution of conservation laws on stretched, curvilinear, and deforming meshes. To illustrate these procedures, we focus on up to 6th-order Pade-type spatial discretizations coupled with up to 10th-order low-pass filters. These are combined with explicit and implicit time integration methods to examine wave propagation and wall-bounded flows described by the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations. It is shown that without the incorporation of the filter, application of the high-order compact scheme to nonsmooth meshes results in spurious oscillations which inhibit their applicability. Inclusion of the discriminating low-pass high-order filter restores the advantages of high-order approach even in the presence of large grid discontinuities. When three-dimensional curvilinear meshes are employed, the use of standard metric evaluation procedures significantly degrades accuracy since freestream preservation is violated. To overcome this problem, a simple technique is adopted which ensures metric cancellation and thus ensures freestream preservation even on highly distorted curvilinear meshes. For dynamically deforming grids, an effective numerical treatment is described to evaluate expressions containing the time-varying transformation metrics. With these techniques, metric cancellation is guaranteed regardless of the manner in which grid speeds are defined. The efficacy of the new procedures is demonstrated by solving several model problems as well as by application to flow past a rapidly pitching airfoil and past a flexible panel.},

In particular, based on domain-specific knowledge about algorithms of the DLA kernels, we use a collection of parameterized code templates to formulate a number of commonly occurring instruction sequences within the optimized low-level C code of these DLA kernels. Then, our framework uses a specialized low-level C optimizer to identify instruction sequences that match the pre-defined code templates and thereby translates them into extremely efficient SSE/AVX instructions. The DLA kernels generated by our templatebased approach surpass the implementations of Intel MKL and AMD ACML BLAS libraries, on both Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Piledriver processors.},

To date, there has not been a sufficiently optimized BLAS on the Loongson 3A CPU. The purpose of this research is to optimize level 3 BLAS performance on the Loongson 3A CPU. We analyzed the Loongson 3A architecture and built a performance model to highlight the key point, L1 data cache misses, which is different from level 3 BLAS optimization on the mainstream x86 CPU. Therefore, we employed a variety of methods to avoid L1 cache misses in single thread optimization, including cache and register blocking, the Loongson 3A 128-bit memory accessing extension instructions, software prefetching, and single precision floating-point SIMD instructions. Furthermore, we improved parallel performance by reducing bank conflicts among multiple threads in the shared L2 cache. We created an open source BLAS project, OpenBLAS, to demonstrate the performance improvement on the Loongson 3A quad-core processor.},

Fewer degrees of freedom, approximation properties for elliptic problems together with the number of optimization techniques, such as static condensation, available within CG framework made it challenging for DG methods to be competitive until recently. However, with the introduction of a static-condensation-amenable DG method{\textemdash}the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method{\textemdash}it has become possible to perform a realistic comparison of CG and HDG methods when applied to elliptic problems. In this work, we extend upon an earlier 2D comparative study, providing numerical results and discussion of the CG and HDG method performance in three dimensions. The comparison categories covered include steady-state elliptic and time-dependent parabolic problems, various element types and serial and parallel performance. The postprocessing technique, which allows for superconvergence in the HDG case, is also discussed. Depending on the direct linear system solver used and the type of the problem (steady-state vs. time-dependent) in question the HDG method either outperforms or demonstrates a comparable performance when compared with the CG method. The HDG method however falls behind performance-wise when the iterative solver is used, which indicates the need for an effective preconditioning strategy for the method.},

Specifically, the software is designed to provide optimal computational performance for multiscale problems, which require highly stable, implicit, time-stepping schemes combined with a parallel implementation of adaptivity in both space and time. By combining these implicit, adaptive discretizations with an optimally efficient nonlinear multigrid solver it is possible to obtain computational solutions to a very high resolution with relatively modest computational resources. The first half of the paper describes the numerical methods that lie behind the software, along with details of their implementation, whilst the second half of the paper illustrates the flexibility and robustness of the tool by applying it to two very different example problems. These represent models of a thin film flow of a spreading viscous droplet and a multi-phase-field model of tumour growth. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges of obtaining highly scalable parallel performance for a software tool that combines both local mesh adaptivity, requiring efficient dynamic load-balancing, and a multigrid solver, requiring careful implementation of coarse grid operations and inter-grid transfer operations in parallel.},

  abstract = {The performance of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the continuous streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method in the computation of steady viscoelastic flows have been compared in this paper. For the continuous SUPG method it is necessary to include the elastic-viscous-split-stress (EVSS) formulation to satisfy the compatibility requirement on the velocity-stress interpolation (SUPG/ EVSS), while for the discontinuous Galerkin method both the pure mixed formulation (DG/MIX) and the EVSS formulation (DG/EVSS) have been tested. We first examine a benchmark smooth problem, i.e. the steady flow of an upper convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid around a sphere falling along the axis of a cylindrical tube, by using high-order finite element approximation. DG/MIX is found not to be a stable discretization in this problem, its limiting Weissenberg number decreases with increasing the interpolation order; on the other hand, DG/EVSS is an accurate and stable algorithm, its solution converges as the approximation order increases (the so-called p-convergence) and it produces almost identical stress boundary layers to that of the SUPG/EVSS algorithm at a Weissenberg number as high as 2.0. To explore benefits of the discontinuous interpolation for the stress in the DG method, we further examine two benchmark problems with stress singularities by using low-order interpolations on sufficiently fine meshes; they are the axisymmetric steady flows of the modified Chilcott and Rallison (MCR) fluid through a four-to-one abrupt contraction and in a tube with the stick-to-slip transition in the wall velocity boundary condition. In the contraction problem the DG/EVSS method is found to be a significant improvement over the SUPG/EVSS method, quality of the solutions is better for DG/EVSS and a much higher Weissenberg number limit is observed. In the stick-slip problem both DG/EVSS and SUPG/EVSS are very robust, they confront no limit of the Weissenberg number and predict asymptotic stress profiles as the number becomes sufficiently large. In both problems the pure mixed method DG/MIX produces severe stress oscillations near the singularities and fails to converge at medium Weissenberg numbers.},

  abstract = {Surface topography has been considered a difficult task for seismic wave numerical modelling by the finite-difference method (FDM) because the most popular staggered finite-difference scheme requires a rectilinear grid. Even though there are numerous collocated grid schemes in other computational fields that could be used to solve the first-order hyperbolic equations, the lack of a stable free-surface boundary condition implementation for curvilinear grids also obstructs the adoption of curvilinear grids in seismic wave FDM modelling. In this study, we use generalized curvilinear grids that can fit the surface topography to discretize the computational domain and describe the implementation of a collocated grid finite-difference scheme, a higher order MacCormack scheme, to solve the first-order hyperbolic velocity-stress equations on the curvilinear grid. To achieve a sufficiently accurate and stable free-surface boundary condition implementation on the curvilinear grids, we propose the traction image method that antisymmetrically images the traction components instead of the stress components to the ghost points above the free surface. Since the velocity derivatives at the free surface are provided by the free-surface condition, we use a compact scheme to compute the velocity derivatives near the free surface and avoid the use of velocity values on the ghost points. Numerical tests verify that using the curvilinear grid, the collocated finite-difference scheme and the traction image technique can simulate seismic wave propagation in the presence of surface topography with sufficient accuracy.},

Although there have been extensive works in the past that have presented approaches to resolve these so called Marangoni flows at the phase boundaries, the question of how to efficiently resolve the interface in a universal and conservative manner remains largely open in comparison. Such problems are of high practical relevance in many manufacturing processes, especially in the microfluidic regime where capillary effects dominate the local force equilibria. In this work, we present a freely available numerical solver based on the Finite Volume Method that is able to resolve arbitrarily complex, incompressible multi phase systems with the mentioned physics at phase boundaries. An efficient solution with respect to the number of degrees of freedom can be obtained by either using high order WENO stencils or by employing adaptive cell refinement. We demonstrate the capabilities of the solver by investigating a model benchmark case as well as a single track laser melting process that is highly relevant within laser additive manufacturing.},
